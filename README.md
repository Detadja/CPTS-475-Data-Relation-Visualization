# CPTS-475-Data-Relation-Visualization

* This is a school project created in R. It takes in the csv datasets `flights.csv`, `planes.csv`, `weather.csv`, `airlines.csv`, and `airports.csv` (the latter two files have been corrupted and couldn't be uploaded to github) to determine specific information from the data. Then, it takes in the csv dataset `us-presidents.csv`, to visualize and analyze two presidential voting maps for two separate years. In both cases, the outputs were the results of the search as well as the plots created, and the pdf outputs via the results in the Rmd file. Additionally, a short piece of literary media was used to analyze and tally the frequency of words used and the output was a word map created with the data.

* Last updated on: 4th Oct 2022, as Assignment 4 for the course Cpts 475 - Data Science.

* This program was written in R. To run, import files to local system and run on R Studio.
